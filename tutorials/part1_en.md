# Part 1

The first part of the "BADASS" (BGP At Doors of Autonomous Systems is Simple) project is an **introduction to GNS3 simulator**. We have to learn how to set up our work environment in a Linux virtual machine.

What will be covered is how to import Docker images into GNS3 software and how to configure the **FRRouting** daemons file (located at `/etc/frr/daemons`) to run the services required by the assignment.

## Requirements

The project run inside a Linux virtual machine in which must be installed:

- GNS3
- Docker

Follow this guide: [GNS3 Linux Install](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/getting-started/installation/linux/).

## Walkthrough

### 1. Pull Docker images

**Docker** containers are used as ligth virtual machines. This is **not a production-ready** use case.

1. Pull the router Docker image:

   ```sh
   $ docker pull frrouting/frr:v8.4.0
   ```

   **FRRouting** is an open-source network project including everything needed to complete the assignment.

2. Pull the host Docker image:

   ```sh
   $ docker pull alpine:3.21.3
   ```

### 2. Set up GNS3

1. Start GNS3.

2. Create a new project named `P1` as required by the assignment.

3. Now, time to add **Docker templates** to GNS3. In the menu bar, click on `Edit` > `Preferences`. A new window will open. In the left menu, select `Docker containers`.

4. Click on `New` and select the Alpine image from the list.

   Configure the template. Name it with your 42 username as follows: `host_<username>`. Since it will be used as a host, this machine only needs one network adapter. However, let's set the default number of adapter to 2 since the project requires so.

5. Repeat this operation with the router image. Name it with your 42 username as follows: `router_<username>`.

6. Continue configuring the templates. Display the available devices by clicking the corresponding icons in the left menu:

   <img src="/tutorials/assets/p1/gns3_device_menu.png" alt="GNS3 device list" height="400"/>

   The router doesn't look like one. Right-click on it and select `Configure template`. Find the `Symbol` field and select the icon required in the assignment.

### 3. Create the network

1. From the device list, drag and drop the Alpine host and the router. Right-click on the router, choose `Configure` and remove the `-<N>` suffix to meet the assignment requirements.

2. Start the router in the topology and open a new auxiliary console window by right-clicking on the router icon and `Auxiliary console`. The assignment requires:
     - The service BGPD active and configured.
     - The service OSPFD active and configured.
     - An IS-IS routing engine service.

   To meet these requirements, we must explicitely enable the daemons in the configuration file named `/etc/frr/daemons`. **FRR's official documentation explains all of it [here](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/setup.html).**

   Open the file with a text editor such as `vi`. Enable the `bgpd`, `ospfd` and `isisd` daemons by changing the value from `no` to `yes`.

   `vtysh_enable` can be set to `yes` too in order to `vtysh` to apply configuration when starting the daemons.

3. Start the host in the topology.

4. Open both devices auxiliary console and run `ps` to check the output matches the assignment's one.

### 4. Save the project

Since the changes won't persist after the devices stop, save the `/etc/frr/daemons` file.

The project must be saved as a ZIP archive. In the menu bar, click `File` > `Export portable project`. Don't forget to include the base images to match the requirements.

## Defense

The [`docker` directory](/docker/) contains a Dockerfile for the router based on FRR's with the configured daemons file.

Assuming you are at the directory's root:

```sh
$ docker build -t router_mboivin docker
```

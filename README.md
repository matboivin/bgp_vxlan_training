# BGP At Doors of Autonomous Systems is Simple

`BADASS` (BGP At Doors of Autonomous Systems is Simple) is a team project of *42*, a computer programming school.

It is about discovering **VXLAN** and **BGP EVPN** by configuring networks in GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator-3).

I enjoyed this school project as it allowed me to explore both networking theory and general knowledge.

## Content

- [tutorials](/tutorials/): Detailed walkthroughs to complete the assignment (both in French and English).

There are also personal notes about good practices I discovered. Sometimes, I disagreed with the assignment or tutorials details and wrote about it.
